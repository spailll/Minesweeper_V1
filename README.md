# Minesweeper_V1    BY: BEN SAILOR

This was just a project I decided to do for fun today. It took using swing, awt, recursion, 
and a lot of problem solving, but after 6-10 hours this is the final product.
It is not intended to be perfect, But it was a fun project to work on to aid in my development 
as a programmer. If there are any issues, or any areas where i can improve the program, or my 
methods in the future please feel free to reach out and let me know.
